# EyeMod

Don't get us wrong, this is our first mod. Neither of us have any serious coding experience for something as 'serious' as this.
However, we have an advantage. Motivation and determination. Other than that, we're hopeless.

## Our crew:

### M3M31UrD (atd1010): Organizer, Lead Art Designer, and Developer

### <a href="https://mi460.dev/github">(MC)Mi460: Lead Developer, IT guy</a>


## Plans:

The mod will hopefully end with our results of:

- A new surprisingly difficult bullet-hell pre-hardmode boss (the King Creeper)

- Multiple expert mode and not drops

- Useful accessories

- Spicy emotes.


If you'd like an 'official beta tester' job and even your own cool item (your design) added to the game, then just join <a href="https://mi460.dev/discord">my discord server</a> and ping me for an application/request.


Thanks for being cool and checking us out.
