# EyeMod

Don't get us wrong, this is our first mod. Neither of us have any serious coding experience for something as 'serious' as this.
However, we have an advantage. Motivation and determination. Other than that, we're hopeless.

## Our crew:

### M3M31UrD (atd1010): Organizer, Lead Art Designer, and Developer

### (MC)Mi460: Lead Developer


## Plans:

The mod will hopefully end with our results of:

- A new surprisingly difficult bullet-hell pre-hardmode boss (the King Creeper)

- Multiple expert mode and not drops

- Useful accessories

- Spicy emotes.



Thanks for checking us out.
